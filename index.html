            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Being a polytechnic means that our programs are career-focused and responsive to changes in competitive global job markets. Humber professors bring a wealth of relevant industry experience to the classroom. Class sizes are small, and simulation labs and work placements bridge the gap between classroom and industry. We put theory into practice from day one, which is important because work-integrated learning means you will have experience working in your industry before you graduate! When you leave Humber you will be a professional, poised and ready to make your mark. </p>
            <p>
                Multimedia Design and Development is one of the three programs within our interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Web Design and Interactive Media program, and the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers you exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields. Greater exposure to the ever-evolving exciting world of design and development will allow you to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then you will confirm your focus prior to your second semester of study.
